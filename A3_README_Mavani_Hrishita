npm - Node Package Manager
```

- Install and enable this [CORS extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf?hl=en) to run the project on Heroku.

- git

Clone the repo, and run the following commands for installing the dependencies.

### Installing

```
npm install
```

The following command will run the application on your localhost.

## Steps to follow to run the app

1. Clone git repo using `git clone https://git.cs.dal.ca/maurya/csci-5709-project.git`

2. `cd client`

3. Install all dependencies using `npm install`

4. Start application in dev environment using `npm run start`

5. `cd ..`

6. `cd server`

7. Install all dependencies using `npm install`

8. Start application in dev environment using `npm run start`

## A step by step process to deploy the app on heroku

1. Install NPM packages. `npm install`

2. Authenticate heroku account via heroku CLI. `heroku login`

3. Create a new app on heroku. `heroku apps:create project-name`

4. Add heroku remote to the project. `heroku git:remote -a project-name`

5. Push the code on heroku. `git push heroku master`

## Built With
