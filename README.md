## Authors

* [Smily](smily@dal.ca) - *(Owner)*

## Deployment

The application has been deployed on Heroku. 
* The URL is: https://smily-assignment1.herokuapp.com/
* The task specific url is: https://smily-assignment1.herokuapp.com/destinations

## Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - The library used for building the front-end.
* [Material UI](https://mui.com/) - To build responsive User Interface components - navigation bar, pagination and cards layout.
* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - Used to do the routing in the application (home and destinationsu) since react does not have anything in-built.

## Components Used

For the completion of this assignment, I have used the components provided by [Material UI](https://mui.com/) 
The components used are:

* App Bar 
* Theming
* Grid
* Typography
* Box
* Form Grooup
* Checkbox
* Icon Button
* Tool Bar

## Steps to verify the tasks

### Task 1 - Display all the destinations

* Use the [application link](https://smily-assignment1.herokuapp.com/) to access the deployed application.
* The system will display a dummy dashboard page.
* Use the top navigation link "Destinations" to navigate to the destinations page.
* System will display all the destinations present.

### Task 2 - Search destination using the search box

* Follow the steps in task 1 to navigate to the destinations page or use the [link](https://smily-assignment1.herokuapp.com/destinations) directly.
* Enter some text in the search box and click the search button.
* If the destination with the name that matches the text in search box is present, the matched destination will be displayed.
* If the destination does not exists the system will display a message - "Destination not present. Please search for another one or select from the list."

## Important Notes

There are certain components - pagination, add to bucket list (heart), and filter by which are present on the UI but their functionality hasn't been implemented yet. They have been added to match the wireframe for the page and will be covered later in the project development phase.
