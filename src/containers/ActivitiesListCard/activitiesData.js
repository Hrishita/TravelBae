      "'First settled in the 1860s, Africville was a thriving African Nova Scotian community nestled on the edge of Halifax Harbour. In the 1960s, its buildings were destroyed and residents displaced to free up land for Halifax’s industrial expansion. Today, the Africville Museum stands in a replica of the church that was the emotional heart of Africville.  Inside, audio visual kiosks, pictures, descriptive panels, and artifacts tell the story of the Africville community by commemorating the injustice of this destruction and celebrating the strong community spirit that still endures to this day.'",
